#   - hasTrace: any existing reasoning trace -> backfill regardless of the
#     thinking flag.
# Upstream also validates len(reasoning) > 0, so an empty placeholder is not
# enough on its own: `reasoning` is mirrored with a non-empty value.

# Responses API "custom" (freeform) tools
#
# Some clients - most notably Codex 0.15x - declare their file-editing tool as a
# *custom* (freeform) tool rather than a JSON-schema function:
#
#     {"type": "custom", "name": "apply_patch", "format": {...grammar...}}
#
# and expect the model to answer with a custom_tool_call item carrying the raw
# payload in "input", then feed the result back as custom_tool_call_output.
#
# The upstream chat endpoint has no notion of custom tools, so we downgrade them
# to ordinary function tools with a single "input" string parameter on the way
# out, and re-inflate them to custom_tool_call on the way back. Without this the
# tool is silently ignored: the model emits the payload as ordinary prose and the
# client never sees a tool call (measured: 52 text deltas, 0 tool items).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# namespace 工具拒絕
#
# Codex 會把 MCP server / 外掛工具用 type="namespace" 的形式送出來。實測行為：

#                                -> 每一次呼叫都回 "unsupported call"
#   反代「拒絕」namespace 工具 -> app 自動 fallback 成 flat function 清單
#                                -> 全部工具恢復正常
# （此行為在 Command Code proxy.mjs 的 CC_REJECT_NAMESPACE_TOOLS 實驗裡有記載，
#   Agent Router 也是靠直接拒絕這類請求才正常的。）
#
# 所以在這裡主動回一個格式明確的 400，逼 app 走 fallback。
# 想還原成「照單全收」就把 REJECT_NAMESPACE_TOOLS 改成 False。
